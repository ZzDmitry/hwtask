1. Given two non-negative integers x and y represented as strings, return the sum of x and y. 

    The length of both numbers is < 5100.
    Both numbers contain only digits 0-9.
    Both numbers do not contain any leading zero.

 

2. You are given two or more non-empty linked lists representing two or more non-negative integers.

The integers are stored in reverse order with each node of the list containing a single digit.

Implement a sum of those lists, return it as a linked list.

Integers do not have leading zeros, the only exception is the number 0 itself.

Example:

Input: (7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 0 -> 1) + 0 + (9-> 8 -> 9)

Output: 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> 1 -> 1 

Explanation: 10987 + 0 + 989 = 11976.
